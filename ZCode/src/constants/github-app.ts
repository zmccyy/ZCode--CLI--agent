export const PR_BODY = `## Installing ${PRODUCT_NAME} GitHub App

This PR adds a GitHub Actions workflow that enables ${PRODUCT_NAME} integration in our repository.

### What is ${PRODUCT_NAME}?

[${PRODUCT_NAME}](${PRODUCT_URL}) is an AI coding agent that can help with:
- Bug fixes and improvements
- Documentation updates
- Implementing new features
- Code reviews and suggestions
- Writing tests
- And more!

### How it works

Once this PR is merged, we'll be able to interact with ${PRODUCT_NAME} by mentioning @${COMMAND_NAME} in a pull request or issue comment.
Once the workflow is triggered, ${PRODUCT_NAME} will analyze the comment and surrounding context, and execute on the request in a GitHub Action.

### Important Notes

- This workflow won't take effect until this PR is merged.
- @${COMMAND_NAME} mentions won't work until after the merge is complete.
- The workflow runs automatically whenever ${PRODUCT_NAME} is mentioned in PR or issue comments.
- ${PRODUCT_NAME} gets access to the full PR or issue context, including files, diffs, and previous comments.

### Security

- Our Anthropic API key is securely stored as a GitHub Actions secret.
- Only users with write access to the repository can trigger the workflow.
- All ${PRODUCT_NAME} runs are stored in the GitHub Actions run history.
- ${PRODUCT_NAME}'s default tools are limited to reading and writing files plus interacting with the repo by creating comments, branches, and commits.
- We can add more allowed tools by adding them to the workflow file like:

\`\`\`
allowed_tools: Bash(npm install),Bash(npm run build),Bash(npm run lint),Bash(npm run test)
\`\`\`

There's more information in the [Claude Code action repo](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action).

After merging this PR, try mentioning @${COMMAND_NAME} in a comment on any PR to get started.`
